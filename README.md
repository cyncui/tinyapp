#### CREATING NEW LINKS
To create a new short link, click on the **create new URL** navigation bar, where you will be prompted to enter a url.

#### EDITING AND DELETING LINKS
In the **my URLS** page, you can delete any of your links. You can also edit the long URL if you click on the **edit** button. Only the long URL will be altered, the short URL will remain the same.

#### USING YOUR SHORT URL
The path to use any short link is `/u/shortURL`. This will redirect you to the long URL. You can also visit the long URL by clicking on the short URL link on the edit page.
